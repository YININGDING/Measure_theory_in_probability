> Disclaimer: "These notes are not endorsed by the lecturers, and I have modified them (often significantly) after lectures. They are nowhere near accurate representations of what was actually lectured, and in particular, all errors are almost surely mine" -- Dexter Chua 

By the way, if you are not familiar to GitHub just like me, you can use this link: https://www.overleaf.com/read/tvmdsnbjsbfq, this will redirect you to overleaf and you can directly compile the code and download the PDF file. 

I'm typing the notes on Overleaf, a online LaTeX compiler, and please feel free to leave any comments and star this project if you find this is helpful ^ ^.Have fun in measure theory.
